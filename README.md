Web app to extrude a STL model by a given width, but it stops growing just before it self-intersects.

You can try it online here:

Set the desired width and max number of iterations (final width is searched dicotomically), press on the 'Load STL' button and it will begin processing inmediately.

After it finishes processing it will show a notification and you can press the 'Save STL result' button to save it.
